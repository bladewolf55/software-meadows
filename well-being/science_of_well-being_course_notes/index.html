<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong><br />
These are notes I took in 2018, and they're my most popular posted article. I need to caution you that since then the course has likely changed, as well as some of the material. Science is always on the move, new data supersedes old. So, please don't use this as a substitute for either attending or taking your own notes. If they help your studies of well-being, I'm grateful. If you're using them merely to help pass the course . . . I think you're missing the point. --clf</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What do we think will make us happy?</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="objectives-1">Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Understand that simply knowing is not enough to change behavior</li>
<li>Give examples of what things won’t make you as happy as you think they will</li>
<li>Revise and reconsider goals and aspirations that will not lead to improved well-being</li>
<li>Practice savoring and gratitude every day for at least one week</li>

<ul>
<li>Good job</li>
<li>Lots of money</li>
<li>Awesome stuff</li>
<li>True love</li>
<li>The perfect body</li>
<li>The perfect grades</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-we-have-misconceptions">Why We Have Misconceptions</h3>
<p>Why don't these things make us happy? The two standard answers (especially from students) are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Happiness is just set genetically, so can't really be changed.</li>
<li>Stuff happens and messes things up. (Life circumstances make happiness temporary)</li>
</ol>
<p>These two answers are wrong, according to the data. The genes/circumstances vs our influence breaks down this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>50% Genetic Setpoint</li>
<li>10% Life Happens</li>
<li>40% Thoughts and Actions</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Our thoughts and actions have a 40% influence on our happiness</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A typical fallacy in thinking at this point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;OK, that science stuff might be true for <em>everybody else</em>, but <em>I really</em> will be happy if I have the perfect job/salary/body/grades.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which leads to the first annoying feature of the mind: <em>Our mind's strongest intuitions are often totally wrong.</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">If a baseball and a bat cost $1.10  
together,  and the bat costs $1.00   
more than the ball, how much  
does the ball cost?  
</code></pre>
<p>The intuitive answer is 10 cents. But the correct answer is 5 cents.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="annoying-features-of-the-mind">Annoying Features of the Mind</h3>
<ol>
<li>Our mind's strongest intuitions are often totally wrong</li>
<li>Our minds don't think in terms of absolutes, our minds judge relative to reference points<br />
<strong>Reference Point</strong> A salient (but often irrelevant) standard against which all subsequent information is compared)<br />
<strong>Social Comparison</strong> The act of evaluating one's own salary/status/possessions/abilities/etc relative to those of other people</li>
<li>Our minds are built to get used to stuff
<strong>Hedonic Adaptation</strong>  The process of becoming accustomed to a positive or negative stimulus such that the emotional effects of that stimulus are attenuated over time</li>
<li>We don't realize that our  minds are built to get used to stuff
<strong>Impact Bias</strong> The tendency to overestimate the emotional impact of a future event both in terms of intensity and its duration
<strong>Focalism</strong> The tendency to think just about one event and forget about the other things that happen
<strong>Immune Neglect</strong> Unawareness of our &quot;psychological immune system&quot;, our tendency to adapt to and cope with negative events</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="notes-1">Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Research shows that happy people are motivated to do kind things for others.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Research shows that happy people spend more time with others and have a richer set of social connections than unhappy people&quot;</li>
<li>For every $1 your actual income goes up, your &quot;required income&quot; goes up $1.40. (van Paraat &amp; Frijters, 1999)</li>
<li>The more TV you watch, the more unhappy you are with your income (&quot;estimate of one's own wealth&quot;)</li>
<li>Social media affect on self-esteem due to relative reference points is twice as bad as salary.</li>
<li>It takes about two years for a couple to get used to marriage. At that point, their happiness is about where it was before marriage.</li>
<li>We think that when we get something that makes us happy that we'll continue to maintain the same level of happiness. This is just not true.</li>
<li>Impact Bias is worse for negative events. In other words, we think we'll be way unhappier about a negative event that we actually end up being.</li>
<li>AND, we don't get better at our estimates with experience. (example: repeatedly taking driver's exam)</li>
<li>[clf] I think I'm pretty good about avoiding focalism. I may be wrong, but I think I consider all the other things that won't change just because I get the thing I want.</li>
<li>Kids today tend to be risk-averse, and don't realize how well they can cope. They're mispredicting how well they'll recover.</li>
<li>I love the CV story:
<blockquote>
<p>I think if we created a culture of social media where you gave like the full picture of what it looked like, then that might actually be good, then those might be yardsticks that actually didn't have these detrimental effects. We talked last time with the folks that stuck around about an example in academics where this researcher created his real CV or his real resume. And so, usually, you see people's CV, and it's just all their papers and all their events. But he actually made the real one, which is like all the things he applied for, but didn't get. And there was like all of this, it was like rejected from this grad. This paper got rejected 17 times and you had to submit this was really crappy journal. And I like went through and I felt like if you saw that, you wouldn't feel so bad, because you see your real resume. You see all the stuff that failed.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>People mispredict the result of interacting with strangers. They think they'll be rejected, when it's much more likely they'll be accepted.</li>
<li>The random kindness benefit seems to be strongest not through reciprocation but through strengthening the social connections.</li>
<li>It seems like we see other people's rewards as our own. So, doing something nice for someone else seems like something nice was done for us</li>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="objectives-3">Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Understand that experiential purchases are a better investment than material ones</li>
<li>Give examples of intentional activities you can do to overcome cognitive biases and improve your mood</li>
<li>Practice healthy habits like exercising for 30 minutes a day and getting over 7 hours of sleep a night</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rewirements-3">Rewirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Exercise</li>
<li>Sleep.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="overcome-biases">Overcome Biases</h3>
<ol>
<li>Rethink &quot;Awesome Stuff&quot; (mitigate hedonic adaptation)
<ul>
<li>Don't invest in stuff in the first place. It doesn't continue to make us happy, and it sticks around.</li>
<li>Instead, invest in experiences.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Thwart Hedonic Adaptation
<ul>
<li><strong>Savoring</strong> The act of stepping outside of an experience to review and appreciate it
<ul>
<li><em>Help savoring</em>  Talk to another person about it, look for others to share it with, think about how lucky you are, think about sharing later with others, show physical expressions of energy, laugh or giggle, think about how proud you were, be absorbed in the present</li>
<li><em>Hurt savoring</em>  focus on the future when it will be over, remind yourself it will be over soon, tell yourself it wasn't as good as hoped, remind yourself nothing lasts forever, think about how it will never be this good again, think about ways it could be better, tell yourself you don't deserve it.</li>
<li>More controversial way: take photos. Beneficial way is to use camera as new way to see things, harmful way is to only focus on the picture, not the experience.</li>
<li>Habit of replaying happy memories. &quot;Three days/week, for eight minutes, relive a happy experience as if rewinding a videotape and playing it back&quot; Sustained positive emotions four weeks later!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Negative Visualation</strong> Thinking about the reverse that could have happened
<ul>
<li>Couples wrote for 15 minutes about how they might never have met their partner, controls wrote about how they met. The former had a higher boost in happiness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Make This Day Your Last</strong> What if specific situations in your life were going to end <em>soon</em> in a real way.
<ul>
<li>Such as &quot;think about graduating.&quot; Imagining it &quot;soon&quot; and all the good things you &quot;had&quot; increased happiness. Imagining it &quot;far&quot; decreased happiness.</li>
<li>Think about losing something that makes you happy, good things pop up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Gratitude</strong> The quality of being thankful and a tendeny to show appreciation for what one has
<ul>
<li>Writing down five things is very powerful</li>
<li>Sharing is even more powerful. Seligman's &quot;one letter of gratitude delivered in person&quot; yielded six months of effect.</li>
<li>The act of expressing gratitude from a superior increases work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reset Your Reference Points
<ul>
<li><strong>Concretely Re-Experience</strong> Reexperience what your previous reference point was.</li>
<li><strong>Concretely Observe</strong> Find a reference point that's not as good as yours. Really see what the other half is like.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Social Comparisons</strong> The worst kinds of reference points are other people.
<ul>
<li>Stop Technique: if you recognize these comparisons, just say &quot;Stop&quot;.</li>
<li>Experience gratitudes.</li>
<li>Be conscious of the kinds of social comparisons coming in.</li>
<li>Get rid of social media</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Interrupt Your Consumption</strong> Pause and come back to the positive experience, which resets the reference point
<ul>
<li>Correlary: for bad things, do it all at once to hedonically adapt as quickly as possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Increase Your Variety</strong> So, reset reference point and interrupt comparison. Don't eat the chocolate ice cream cone each day. Or, space out when you have the enjoyable thing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="notes-2">Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Focus not on the <em>getting</em> things we think make us happy, but on <em>healthy practices</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>In the study Babyak et al. (2000), they found that the relapse into depression among major depressants was lowest--and recovery from depression highes--in people who only exercised. Exercise was 30/day, 3x/week.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Congnitive performance is also significantly better with more physical exercise. (Not necessarily doing cognitive exericises)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some researchers recommend a nap in the middle of the day to get a cognitive boost. (That's <em>not</em> what's going on with me!)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Insights also come threefold more with enough sleep</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Part of us believes the new car is better because it lasts longer. But in fact that's <em>the worst thing</em> about the new car... It will stay around to disappoint you. --Dan Gilbert</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A new car sticks around to disappoint you. But a trip to Europe is over. It evaporates. It has the good sense to go away, and you are left with nothing but a wonderful memory. --Dan Gilbert</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Investing in experiences over stuff holds across income levels. But as income goes up, the gap widens. The more money you make, the more experience makes you happy, and things don't.</li>
<li>Thinking about an experience <em>in advance</em> gives a higher happiness boost than with things.</li>
<li>Telling people about experiences is better socially than telling about stuff.</li>
<li>Social comparison is harder with experiences than stuff, so not only are you (the experiencer) happier, but also the people you engage with are happier.</li>
<li>Interestingly, in Emmons &amp; McCullough (2010) study on listing gratitudes, the &quot;mental&quot; happiness reported by people who listed hassles, and the control group who listed life experiences, were about the same. Hassles had a more negative affect on subjective and objective physical well-being. People reported worse symptoms, and exercised less.</li>
<li>Could it be that commercials help us enjoy TV shows more? In Nelson et al. (2009) study says yes. (Personal note: The study was using a sitcom, and I imagine it originally had commercials. I think this might be different than a show designed without commercials--or, a film.)</li>

<li><p>Gratitude Letter/Visit</p>
<p>One of your last rewirements is one that research suggests will have a big impact on your happiness and that of another person. This week, write a letter of gratitude to someone you care about. For this assignment, think of one living person who has made a big difference in your life, but whom you never properly thanked. Then find a quiet spot when you have a half-hour free and write a heartfelt letter to that person explaining how he or she has touched your life and why he or she is meaningful to you. Your letter can be as long as you want, but try to make it at least 300 words or so. Then you must deliver that letter to the person in question. Just say you want to talk to that person without explaining why. You could read the letter to your chosen person over the phone or Skype, but for an extra huge happiness boost, we recommend scheduling a time to visit this person in person to share your letter. However you meet up, you should read the letter aloud. We also recommend that you both have some tissues handy for this one. A gratitude letter is one of the most powerful tool for increasing happiness because it can forge social bonds and really change someone’s life.</p>

<p><em>Wanting the Right Parts of What We Already Want</em></p>
<ol>
<li><p>What factors should we want in a job? Signature Strengths and Increasing Flow.
<strong>Character Strengths</strong> [Martin Seligman] A desire, a disposition to act, or a feeling that involves the exercise of judgment that leads to a recognizable human excellence or instance of human flourishing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ubiquitous (widely recognized across cultures)</li>
<li>Fulfilling (leads to fulfillment, satisfaction)</li>
<li>Morally-valued</li>
<li>Not able to dimish others</li>
<li>The oppostive of a negative trait</li>
<li>Trait-like (stable individual difference)</li>
<li>Measurable</li>
<li>Distinctive (Not redundant w/ other strengths)</li>
<li>Paragons (some people really have it)</li>
<li>Prodigies (some people precociously have it)</li>
<li>Selective absence (some people don't have it)</li>
<li>Institutionalized (society values it)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Signature Strengths</strong> Those character strengths that are most essential to who we are	<br />
&quot;Use one of your top strengths in a new and different way every day for one week.&quot; Seligman et al. (2005)</p>
<p><strong>Increasing Flow</strong> The mental state in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment (aka &quot;the zone&quot;)</p>
<ul>
<li>Challenging but attainable goals</li>
<li>Strong focused concentration</li>
<li>The activity is intrinsically rewarding</li>
<li>Feelings of serenity</li>
<li>Loss of self-consciousness</li>
<li>Timelessness / lose track of time passing</li>
<li>Lack of awareness of physical needs</li>
<li>Complete focus on the activity itself</li>
</ul>
<p>How to achieve flow?</p>
<ul>
<li>Looking at challenge and skill, having above 50% in both leads to flow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Good Grades, What to Really Focus On?</p>
<ul>
<li>What goes wrong? <strong>Extrinsic Motivation</strong> Engaging ina behavior in order to earn external rewards or avoid punishments</li>
<li>What goes right? <strong>Intrinsic Motivation</strong> Engaging in a behavior because you enjoy the activity itself</li>
<li>Extrinsic motivation <em>can undermine</em> instrinsic motivation. Grades are an extrinsic motivator that tends to remove the love of learing.</li>
<li>A focus on grades can reduce or prevent a growth mindset.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Growth Mindset</strong> The belief that intelligence can be trained and that most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work.</p>
<p><strong>Fixed Mindset</strong> The belief that basic qualities like intelligence and talent are fixed traits</p>
<ul>
<li>A growth mindset can be learned. Hard work is good. Effort leads to success.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="better-wanting-part-2">Better Wanting Part 2</h3>
<p><em>Wanting Better Stuff That We Don't Want Yet (what should be want)</em></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Kindness (we should be seeking opportunities to be kind). Just thinking about being kind increases happiness. Doing it is even better.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Social Connection</p>
<ul>
<li>Less vulnerable to premature death, more likely to survive fatal illnessess, less likely to fall prey to stressful events</li>
<li>More friends, strong family, more romance = very happy</li>
<li>Amount of time spent with people predicts happiness</li>
<li>The science supports that social connections with strangers increases happiness for both the instigator and the recipient--which is the opposite of what they predict.</li>
<li>Shared experience increases enjoyment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="better-wanting-part-3">Better Wanting Part 3</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Time Affluence</strong> Feeling like you have enough time to do the things you actually want to do.</li>
<li>Mind Control
<ul>
<li><strong>Mind-Wandering</strong> A shift in the contents of thought away from an ongoing task and/or from events in the external envronment to self-generated thoughts and feelings.</li>
<li>People mine-wander 46.9% of the time.</li>
<li>People mind-wander 30% of the time in almost all activities (except sex)</li>
<li>Mind-wandering has a negative impact on happiness</li>
<li><strong>Default Network</strong> A network of interacting brain regions known to activate &quot;by default&quot; when a person is not involved in a task. The DMN is really fast, comes on within a fraction of a second after a task. The DMN thinks outside the here and now (past, future, others). These regions light up when not thinking about the here and now.</li>
<li><strong>Meditation</strong> A practice of turning your attention away from distracting thoughts toward a single point of reference (e.g. the breath bodily sensations, compassion, a specific thought, etc.)</li>
<li>Meditation builds and strengthens brain matter. Gray matter increases.</li>
<li>Meditation increases social closeness</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Healthy Practices
<ul>
<li>Exercise</li>
<li>Quality sleep 7+ hours/day</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="notes-3">Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Consciously using signature strengths increased happiness and decreased depression</li>
<li>Increased use of signature strengths at work improved productivity and job satisfaction</li>
<li>The sweet spot for using signature strengths is 4 of the top 7, which corresponds to a person thinking of a job as a &quot;calling.&quot; The graph also showed a big jump in positive work experience from 3 strengths to 4, then it somewhat levels off.</li>
<li>This use of signature strengths is similar to what I've told people, &quot;find your 'genius'&quot; and be sure your work lets you use that. But this is stronger because a) it's validated science, and b) it's multiple strengths.</li>
<li>[Passive] Leisure <em>seems</em> like what we'd rather be doing, but it isn't. Being in flow is what satisfies us (high challenge and skill)</li>
<li>Don't worry about grades. Worry about learning the material.</li>
<li>Doing a bunch of acts of kindness in one day give a bigger result than doing one a day. This is a surprise. But it implies to me that several acts per day is the way to go.</li>
<li>Spending money on others increases our happiness more than spending on ourselves. <em>And</em>, it doesn't matter how much we spend.</li>
<li>In a sense, you can buy happiness--if you spend on others.</li>
<li>People who chronically prioritize time over money (give up their money to have more time) tend to be happier.</li>
<li>Charitable giving where you directly see/experience the impact have the highest increase in happiness.</li>
<li>Using money to eliminate the things we dislike in our day is a way money can buy happiness.</li>
<li>I love the chocolate experiment. The same exact chocoloate tastes better if someone in the room is eating it, too.</li>
<li>It seems people who are time-affluent are also more social.</li>
</ul>
<p>Brewer et all (2011)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Expert meditators (10,000+ hrs) vs controls</p>
</li>
<li><p>Did 3 kinds of meditations</p>
<ul>
<li>Loving Kindness Meditation</li>
<li>Concentration on breath</li>
<li>Choiceless awareness (just notice thoughts, no judgement)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Is the DMN used less during meditation? Yes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Are the other regions being activated? Yes (more connections)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Did this change the default pattern? Yes, curbs mind-wandering long-term</p>
</li>
<li><p>Note to self: look into Loving Kindness Meditation (LKM)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The best moments in our lives are not the passive, receptive, relaxing times. The best moments usually occur if a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile. --Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And interestingly, the wealthier you get, the less likely you are to feel like you have enough time. And that seems to be both a function of the objective realities of wealthy people, for example, working more. But also this sort of subjective perception that as your time becomes more economically valuable, you tend to view it as scarce because what is valuable is scarce. --Elizabeth Dunn</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So consider another study by Danny Kahneman and Angus Deaton, a psychologist or sociologist at Princeton. They did an analysis of about half a million people surveyed by Gallup which looks at the effects of a bunch of different variables factors on happiness and well being. One is money for instance. So, what they did was they calculated in their data set, what's the effect of a fourfold increase in wealth, in income rather not wealth but income, on your happiness just going from the bottom quartile at the top quartile in their income measure, and they compare that against a bunch of other different variables that could also be correlated with happiness. One of them was, &quot;did you report feeling alone yesterday?&quot; The effect of that alone question, effect of feeling alone on happiness was seven times bigger than a fourfold increase in income. It's crushing. I mean it's a huge effect and I think people just dramatically underestimate that and so they miss like simple opportunities to feel happier. --Nicholas Epley</p>

<h2 id="week-6-putting-strategies-into-practice">Week 6 - Putting Strategies into Practice</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>How can we intentionally put these strategies into practice and build healthier habits?</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="objectives-5">Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Understand that your surroundings play a key role in the types of behaviors you engage in</li>
<li>List elements of effective goal setting</li>
<li>Design your environment and practice goal setting strategies to build better habits</li>
<li>Enjoy your time affluence</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rewirements-5">Rewirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Time Affluence: &quot;Surprise! Your rewirement for this week is that you have no rewirement. Appreciate your time affluence. Use the time you would have dedicated to your weekly rewirement homework to do something fun. This extra time is yours and we want you to enjoy it.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="strategies-for-better-habits">Strategies for Better Habits</h3>
<p><strong>Part 1 - Situation Support</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Proximity, convenience, and visibility matter.</li>
</ul>
<p>So,</p>
<ol>
<li>Fix bad environments (get rid of temptations)</li>
<li>Promote healthy environments (increase desires)
<ul>
<li>Use triggers to cue healthier habits</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Part 2 - Goal Setting</strong></p>
<p>Need to think about goals in specific ways in order to achieve them.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Goal Specificity</strong> The degree of quantitative precision with which a goal is specified. (Who what where when measurable)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Goal Visualization</p>
<ul>
<li>Think and feel--indulge--in detail about the goal (&quot;positive thinking&quot;)</li>
<li>Think--dwell--in detail about the barriers to the goal</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mental Contrasting</strong>  A visualization technique involving first thinking of a positive future outcome followed by thinking of obstacles</p>
</li>
<li><p>Goal Planning<br />
<strong>Implementation Intention</strong> A self-regulatory strategy in the form of an &quot;if-then plan&quot; that can lead to better goal attainment.  So, &quot;If I see the cookies, I'm going to grab the banana.&quot; Repeatedly imagining the plan improves the brain's automatic response.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>WOOP</strong><br />
Think about</p>
<ol>
<li>Your <strong>WISH</strong> (detailed goal with metrics)</li>
<li>The best <strong>OUTCOME</strong> (all the positive stuff and feelings)</li>
<li>Potential <strong>OBSTACLES</strong></li>
<li>Your If-Then <strong>PLAN</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Do this every day, several times a day. Takes five minutes in a quiet (uninterrupted), calm environment.</p>
<h3 id="notes-4">Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mental contrasting has the better long-term benefit to achieving and maintaining goals</li>
<li>For easily attained goals, implementation intention doesn't matter much, but for difficult goals, II increases success threefold.</li>
<li>Pracicing WOOP can double effectiveness on the goal ten weeks out.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interview Gabriele Oettingen</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>WOOP is a little bit like a cleaning-up tool so you can clean up your life. You can get rid of those things which might not really belong to you, which you might not really feel passion about. Or that you might not be really kind of able to do in the sense that you feel, okay, there's so much energy and so much costs involved if I want to fulfill that wish. And I put my energy better into things which are more feasible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first part is really the search for the right wish. What do <em>I</em> want? It can be a big, life wish, or small such as what do I want in the next meeting. The result is a wish stated in a few words (&quot;put in front of your mind&quot;).</p>
<p>Likewise, search for the the best outcome (there's clearly an emotion attached to this), leading to a few words you focus on. Then, let you mind go and really imagine and &quot;feel it out.&quot;</p>
<p>Search for the main, inner obstacle. &quot;What is it? No excuses. What is it really?&quot; Phrase it in a few words. Imagine obstacle occuring. Take time to really feel, experience that obstacle. (Notice there's no problem solving.)</p>
<p>Finaly, what could I do to overcome the obstacle? A few words. Then make if-then.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If [obstacle] then I will [effective action]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This takes a lot of mental effort, which triggers automatic processes.</p>
<p>Can use WOOP for a goal you know is feasible. You can also use it to discover if a goal is feasible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So if you have a kind of eerie feeling about a meeting or if you feel, hmm I don't know whether I should go here or I should go there, this course or that course, this life path or that life path. Then you can actually just have the wish and then by identifying the obstacle in you, find out whether this is something you feel that is overcomeable and is also fitting into your life. Or whether this is something maybe doesn't fit in your life so well at the moment. Or maybe you want to have it let go because you have more important things to do. So WOOP is for going for the feasible wishes but then also for understanding whether something is feasible. And then going for those which are feasible, but also letting go from those that are less feasible. So it's really a cleaning up tool.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>WOOP creates associative links, in the brain, linking the outcome with the obstacle and the means to overcome the obstacle.</p>
<p>It also can change the meaning of the obstacle. &quot;So now, that party on Friday night is no longer a fun party but an obstacle to studying.&quot;</p>
<p>The big deal with WOOP is the obstacle. &quot;But without recognizing that actually what my obstacle is these behaviors run into empty.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is 'motivation'? Energy times direction, if you want.&quot;</p>
<p>Negative feedback is no longer a threat, it helps with how to fulfill the wish. It isn't personal.</p>
<p>Wishes come from our needs, and our needs often change.</p>
<p>Isn't evaulative. Treat WOOP like a friend.</p>
<p><em>Don't switch the Os! You have to think about the outcome first.</em></p>
