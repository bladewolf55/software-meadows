      <title>The 50-10 Time Box - Revising Pomodoro for Software Development</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.softwaremeadows.com/posts/the_50-10_time_box_revising_pomodoro_for_software_development_repost/images/time-box.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a slightly edited repost of an article I wrote last year. I think it's valuable enough to promote the technique again, along with the supporting science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us have trouble with three aspects of programming:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cost of interruptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Methods for staying on task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The benefits of taking breaks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these has studies behind it (see References), as well as anecdotal information. The simple question I wanted to answer is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What's an effective work-break cycle for programming?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three most common cycles I know of are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pomodoro - 25 minutes work, 5 minutes break&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;52/17 - 52 minutes work, 17 minutes break&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;90/? - 90 minutes work, then a break&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id="pomodoro"&gt;Pomodoro&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pomodoro Technique is popular, and, besides the work-break cycle, has these suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan the tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check off completed tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Record interruptions so you can return to them outside the work interval&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, Pomodoro, to my knowledge, hasn't been studied scientifically. When I used it for non-programming tasks, I could see the benefit. The more I tried using it for programming, the less effective I found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="the-task-recovery-lag"&gt;The Task Recovery Lag&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous studies show there's a recovery lag when resuming an interrupted task. For software developers, it takes about fifteen minutes to recover the previous context--to &amp;quot;get back to where I was.&amp;quot; The worst time to be interrupted is then there's the highest mental workload. (Like when I'm in the middle of debugging a method having spent twenty minutes understanding how it relates to five other modules.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's a mistake, though, to think only in terms of interruptions. A programmer &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; ramps up when starting (or restarting) a coding session. In other words, we should plan on the first fifteen minutes being devoted to recovering context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="breaks"&gt;Breaks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've worked for hours straight, and thought I was being productive. Maybe sometimes I was. But the research shows that regular breaks improve productivity, because the brain needs that time to recover from fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="the-friction"&gt;The Friction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, where does that leave us regarding Pomodoro?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It takes a programmer at least fifteen minutes to &amp;quot;ramp up&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Pomodoro work period is twenty-five minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That leaves &lt;em&gt;ten minutes or less of effective work time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, no wonder Pomodoro wasn't working out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tried the 52/17 cycle. I found the seventeen minute break too long. I read an article where office workers tried it themselves, and it was pretty challenging. I suspect that the original study wasn't looking at programmers....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are benefits to Pomodoro. The task planning and completion help a lot with emotionally attaching to success, and with chunking down larger items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="proposal-the-50-10-time-box"&gt;Proposal - The 50-10 Time Box&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been trying this for over a year now, and it's working well for me. So, maybe it will work for you, too. Basically, use Pomodoro Technique but with a 50 minute work cycle followed by a ten minute break. This allows for the fifteen minute ramp up, then thirty-five minutes of solid, focused work. I've found that I'm usually ready for a break at the fifty minute mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even if I wasn't &amp;quot;ready&amp;quot; for a break, when I took it I found I needed it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use an online tool named &lt;a href="http://www.marinaratimer.com/"&gt;Marinara Timer&lt;/a&gt; to manage my time boxes. It has a Custom timer where I configured my cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.softwaremeadows.com/posts/the_50-10_time_box_revising_pomodoro_for_software_development_repost/images/2018-04-21%2009_04_45.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I like about this approach?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It aligns on the hour, making it easy to understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I get enough context recovery time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Four cycles gets me to lunch, the remaing four finish my day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A ten minute break is enough to take a walk, catch up on email, even have a short conversation. It's an effective coding break.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That break has often helped me solve a thorny problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improves my task estimates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A complete work session looks like this. I use a Markdown document to track my work sessions, distractions and notes, but paper and pen (or pencil!) would work as well or better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Plan my tasks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-txt"&gt;# Distractions

# Round 1
- [ ] Validation rules
- [ ] Unit tests

# Round 2
- [ ] Review code, make sure setting values correctly
- [ ] Improve queries based on understanding of rules

# Round 3
- [ ] Design workhorse feature

# Round 4
- [ ] Begin coding workhorse feature
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Start my timer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.softwaremeadows.com/posts/the_50-10_time_box_revising_pomodoro_for_software_development_repost/images/2018-04-21%2009_17_06.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Work deliberately, with intense focus. Record distractions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to not noodle around during the work time. Manage distractions! This is a hallmark of &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2007/07/the-making-of-an-expert"&gt;deliberate practice&lt;/a&gt;, and an aspect of &lt;a href="http://whatmeditationreallyis.com/index.php/home-blog/item/470-how-to-meditate-distraction-in-meditation-doesnt-matter.html"&gt;meditation&lt;/a&gt; and mindfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-txt"&gt;# Distractions
- [ ] Email from Luis, not urgent but should get back to him soon.
- [ ] Birthday gift research for Joanie.

# Round 1
- [ ] Validation rules
- [ ] Unit tests
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Check off tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-txt"&gt;# Distractions
- [ ] Email from Luis, not urgent but should get back to him soon.
- [ ] Birthday gift research for Joanie.

# Round 1
- [x] Validation rules
- [ ] Unit tests
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. When the work cycle ends (I'm currently enamoured of the Whoosh sound), take a break.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be hard to stop, but do it. And, I recommend walking away from the desk, and/or closing your work windows, so you don't get sucked back into the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Repeat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was spurred to write this post because of &lt;a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/time-blocking-for-developers-how-to-achieve-flow-stop-being-busy-start-being-productive"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;. The author, Tyler Hakes, gives several examples from his workday of how he reduces interruptions in his day, and it's worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are a bunch of references I read both before and while creating this entry. They include links to the primary research papers that other articles refer to. I've called out some quotes that I found useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://chrisparnin.me/pdf/parnin-icpc09.pdf"&gt;Resumption Strategies for Interrupted Programming Tasks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When resuming an incomplete programming task, the developer must remember their previous working state and recover knowledge about the software. Details of working state might include recalling plans, intentions, and goals. Details of knowledge might include plan progress, component mechanisms, and domain representations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Egmark/chi08-mark.pdf"&gt;The Cost of Interrupted Work: More Speed and Stress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data suggests that people compensate for interruptions by working faster, but this comes at a price: experiencing more stress, higher frustration, time pressure and effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://erichorvitz.com/CHI_2007_Iqbal_Horvitz.pdf"&gt;Disruption and Recovery of Computing Tasks:  Field Study, Analysis, and Directions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220093595_Interrupts_Just_a_Minute_Never_Is"&gt;Just a minute never is&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeMarco reports that the recovery time after a phone call is at least 15 minutes.2 Even though we could not measure recovery time exactly, we believe his estimate to be valid. If more than 10 interrupts occur during a day, the time between the interrupts becomes too short to accomplish product development work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work fragmentation as result of interruptions usually demands extra effort to recover and resume pending activities: a study of 24 information workers found that a worker needs on average 25 minutes to get back on an interrupted task [5]. Similarly, Iqbal and Horvitz [6] found that people experience disorientation and loss of context when multitasking. Czerwinsky et al. found that after experiencing work fragmentation people found it more difficult to perform interrupted tasks and took longer to complete them [7].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

KonMari Six Methods&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be committed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imagine your ideal life before you start&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tidy by category, not location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discard before you re-organize&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the easiest things first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep what sparks joy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author discusses applying the KonMari method to your business. She brings up circle good ideas, especially being more mindful and forward thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing she doesn't expand on is how to involve staff in applying the method. This seems important to me, so that staff have a strong stake in the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that condo recommends completing an entire category rather than an area. this reminds me of software development where you complete a vertical slice of the feature set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quotes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of organizing what you already have, Kondo’s method focuses on getting rid of what you don’t like and don’t need so you’re left surrounded only by things you love and use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steps to KonMari for Your Business
On her website, Kondo shares the six basic principles of the KonMari method. Here’s how to apply them to your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be committed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for KonMari to work, you need to dedicate yourself to doing it wholeheartedly. Ideally, you’d complete the whole process over a weekend or series of days. For businesses, that may not be realistic—but you still need to commit to finishing what you start and working through each category completely before you stop. Otherwise, you’ll lose momentum. For example, set aside the weekend to focus on files and documents so you can get it all done in one fell swoop. If you’re getting your whole company involved, think of it as an offsite meeting and set aside time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imagine your ideal life before you start.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you start decluttering, take some time to think about what you want your business and life to look like when you’re done. What do you want to achieve by decluttering? Do you want your business to be more efficient, more successful, more enjoyable, more appealing for employees? Kondo’s method places great importance on being mindful, introspective and forward-looking. Thinking about why you’re embarking on this project before you start will help you focus when you begin decluttering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tidy by category, not location.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you think of decluttering your office, you might start with straightening your desk or cleaning out a file drawer. Instead, Marie Kondo wants you to declutter each category all at once. In the home, this means taking out all your clothing (from the closet, the dressers, the hall closet, the under-bed storage) and going through it all at once. For your business, it might mean going through all your equipment first, then all your paper documents, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discard before you re-organize.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you’ve cleared out your file cabinets or your computer, you might get inspired to set up a new organizational system right away. Don’t! Wait until your entire decluttering process is finished to organize what’s left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do the easiest things first.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start decluttering with a category that’s easy for you to let go of. For home decluttering, Kondo recommends doing clothes first and sentimental items last, since these are the hardest to let go of. Figure out what’s easiest for you to start with (such as paper documents) before moving onto more difficult areas such as business processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep what sparks joy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KonMari decluttering method involves holding each item in your hands and asking yourself, “Does this spark joy?” Don’t overthink it: go with your first instinct. Of course, not everything in your office will spark joy (I’m looking at you, ream of printer paper). For such items, ask yourself whether it’s necessary to help you accomplish a task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use this method for a surface-level decluttering, such as cleaning out your emails, your file folders and your receipts. But you can also get much more from it if you use it on a deeper level. Ask yourself these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What sparks joy in your business?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s a certain product, service or focus in your business that brings you the most joy, maybe you should put more energy there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if there’s a whole element of your business that doesn’t spark joy?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find out something on this level doesn’t spark joy, it’s time to have some serious conversations and do some soul-searching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you discard an item, Marie Kondo says, you need to thank it for its service to you. (Yes—even if you’re getting rid of an old stapler.) The process helps you “let go,” she says. But when you’re decluttering your business, I think you should also thank the things that you’re keeping. Take some time to feel your appreciation for all the elements that help your business thrive, from your employees to your suppliers to your customers.&lt;/p&gt;

.NET configuration is a special interest of mine, especially since I created a .NET Full configuration package: &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/DeftConfig/"&gt;NuGet Gallery | DeftConfig 1.1.1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've looked at .NET Core's configuration before, and, while impressively complete, it wasn't clear what the common scenarios were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good overview of how configurations work both conceptually and with some implementation. But it doesn't show a &amp;quot;typical configuration&amp;quot; like I'd want to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While configuration data is name-value pairs, the resuling configuration can be nested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order of the ConfigurationBuilder pipeline determines which configurations win when there are duplicates. Last configuration wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Files can be environment-specific, e.g. appsettings.development.json.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;IOptions&lt;/code&gt; approach has no explicit benefit over using a POCO (see article for Esposito's reasoning).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;IOptionsSnapshot&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to re-get settings on each request. Use &lt;code&gt;IOptionsMonitor&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to re-get settings if they change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quotes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you check out the Microsoft documentation, you might be frightened by the number of possible ways you can manage configuration data,...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of an ASP.NET Core application is based on a list of name-value pairs collected at runtime from a variety of data sources—primarily, but not necessarily, one or more JSON files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All loaded values are composed (aggregated) into a single container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The root container is an object that implements the IConfigurationRoot interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-chsarp"&gt;public class Startup
{
    public IConfigurationRoot Configuration { get; }
    public Startup(IHostingEnvironment env)
    {
        var dom = new ConfigurationBuilder()
            .SetBasePath(env.ContentRootPath)
            .AddJsonFile(&amp;quot;appsettings.json&amp;quot;)
            .Build();
 
        // Save the configuration DOM
        Configuration = dom;
 
        // Next tasks:
        //   - Load the config data into a POCO class
        //   - Share the POCO class with the rest of the app
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Three ways to return setting from this JSON)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-json"&gt;{
   &amp;quot;print&amp;quot; : {
       &amp;quot;pageFormat&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;A4&amp;quot;,
       &amp;quot;color&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;true&amp;quot;
   },
   &amp;quot;grid&amp;quot; : {
       &amp;quot;sorting&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;false&amp;quot;,
       &amp;quot;search&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;false&amp;quot;
   }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;var pageFormat = Configuration[&amp;quot;print:pageformat&amp;quot;];

var fmt = Configuration.GetValue&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;(&amp;quot;print:pageformat&amp;quot;);

var fmt = Configuration.GetSection(&amp;quot;print&amp;quot;)
                       .GetValue&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;(&amp;quot;pageformat&amp;quot;);

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ASP.NET Core, instead, you can use the Bind method on the configuration root object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;var appSettings = new GlobalAppSettings();
Configuration.Bind(appSettings);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final step to conclude the first round of application settings in ASP.NET Core 3.0 is sharing the configuration POCO class with the rest of the application. In ASP.NET Core, the recommended approach is using the native Dependency Injection layer. All you need to do is adding the freshly created (and validated) instance of the GlobalAppSettings class as a singleton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;var appSettings = new GlobalAppSettings();
Configuration.Bind(appSettings);
services.AddSingleton(appSettings);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;IOptions&lt;/code&gt; approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;// the code below belongs to the ConfigureServices method of the startup class.

services.AddOptions();
services.Configure&amp;lt;GlobalAppSettings&amp;gt;(Configuration);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;public DemoController(
             IOptions&amp;lt;GlobalAppSettings&amp;gt; options)            
{
   Settings = options.Value;
   ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;IOptionsMonitor&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;var dom = new ConfigurationBuilder()
        .SetBasePath(env.ContentRootPath)
        .AddJsonFile(&amp;quot;appsettings.json&amp;quot;, 
                         optional: true, 
                         reloadOnChange: true);

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ideal approach is to learn the absolute minimum you need to know (which means how to load the configuration as an immutable singleton in a C# POCO class) and then look around in case more is required or would be good to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Kids are growing up with &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; structure, and if the encounter situations where the rules aren't obvious they flounder because they haven't learned to be self-reliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men are falling behind women in terms of adaptation and agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quotes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the podcast: &amp;quot;Paul explains what he means by agency, and why learning how to get better at thinking, acting, and making choices for yourself can be the real key to feeling less stuck in life.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When our minds and bodies are in balance, our decision-making improves, and when our decision-making improves we then create a life that's more in line with matters to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separate your thinking and deliberation from your taking action, especially on important decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're saying yes to something, you're saying no to something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 7 Principles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control Stimuli
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put phone away. Don't let devices determine your attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you want to reach for device, get up an move instead to recharge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monotask, don't multitask.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Associate Selectively
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mirror neurons help us pick and mimic those around us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People closest to us have enormous effect on our level of agency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isolation is like kryptonite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move (using your body, nutrition)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movement increases brain activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're built to move, and we're too sedentary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay attention to body and be in top shape. Some men take better care of their cars than their bodies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep deprivation reduces IQ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When sitting, we communicate &amp;quot;I'm stuck,&amp;quot; leading to learned helplessness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get outside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
4.  Position Yourself as a Learner
*   When we're well-informed, we make better decisions.
*   Identity your learning style [clf: Hopefully not the discredited visual/aural/etc].
*   More than 50% of jobs existing for kids born today won't exist when they become adults.
5.  Manage Your Emotions and Beliefs
*   Emotions are the strongest things happening in our heads.
*   Have your emotions, rather than your emotions having you.
*   Beliefs are better off when we question and update them over time.
*   Values tend to be bedrock things.
*   If we navigate the world with outdated beliefs we don't make better decisions for ourselves.
*   Understand how beliefs and emotions affect our thinking.
6.  Check Your Intuition (what does my gut tell me?)
*&lt;br /&gt;
7.  Deliberate, Then Act
*   Decision-Making
*   We don't get training in making decisions, despite making decisions effectively determing who we are.
*   Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky research on decision-making.
*   System 1 thinking: fast thinking&lt;br /&gt;
*   System 2 thinking: deliberate, rational, analytical&lt;br /&gt;
*   Acting:
*   Four large impediments: procrastination, impulsivity, obsession, perfectionism&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interview with Erwan Le Corre, founder of MovNat physical fitness system and author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Practice-Natural-Movement-Reclaim-Freedom-ebook/dp/B07M75GF7W/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=natural+movement&amp;amp;qid=1557957845&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;The Practice of Natural Movement: Reclaim Power, Health, and Freedom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is a quick summary of a long interview (1h 18m, ouch!). The reason I can do this quickly is I have a pretty good understanding of Le Corre's approach and source for his method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His Natural Movement means to practice the kinds of movements that are part of &lt;em&gt;homo sapien&lt;/em&gt;'s two to three hundred thousand-year-old heritage, specifically: walking, running, balancing, jumping, crawling, climbing, swimming, lifting, carrying, throwing, catching, and self-defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are almost exactly the same skills that made up George Hébert's &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_H%C3%A9bert"&gt;la méthode naturelle&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;: walking, running, equilibrium (balancing), jumping, quadrupedal movement (crawling), climbing, swimming, lifting, throwing, and defending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are only two skills added: carrying and catching, both of which make sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hébert was influenced by what came before him, and his method is a key inspiration for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour"&gt;&lt;em&gt;parkour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MovNat seems to be a professional system, complete with certifications. While it's a business, it doesn't strike me as a sloppy scam. Listening to Le Corre, it's clear he's invested in helping people improve their health, and he has a solid athletic background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He makes a good point that athletics--especially movement responding to an unpredictable environment--improves cognition and problem-solving. Fencer Aldo Nadi said the same thing, that fencing made a person smarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quotes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Not many quotes this time. But I like Le Corre's plain-speaking on some subjects that isn't rude or arrogant. For example, on reducing the amount of recess in schools--or making equipment &amp;quot;too safe&amp;quot;--because of liability, he says, &amp;quot;It's criminal. It's just going to kill the kids even more. It's going to kill their physiology to begin with...there are windows of physiological development and if you miss them it's hard to catch up.... What's needed [at a certain age] is not only proper nutrition, it's also proper movement.... I'm saying this with sadness.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(On doing natural movements &lt;em&gt;while&lt;/em&gt; you're in your normal day)&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You see, it does not take time off of your occupations because you can do it [natural movement] as you do what you need to do. It doesn't cost any money, it doesn't cost time. It costs very little energy, actually...but it's beneficial not only to your physiology but it's beneficial to your work.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019-05-15 22:48&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode was appropriate for me since I'm between jobs--&amp;quot;under employed,&amp;quot; as my mom says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary of the 3 Principles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jobs are about relationships&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most jobs are found through previous, current, or new relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hiring process is very human. The evaluators have the same biases you do. They can be affected by not having eaten breakfast that morning, for example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's not a computer on the other end that's ultimately going to decide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your job search is an evolving and continous process, not a discrete process with a single outcome&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine your values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't hold yourself to one particular title.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the time, the opportunity to be fulfilled in your job will come again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environment-first thinking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depending on your environment, you happiness in a job can vary greatly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask yourself questions about the environment just as much as about skills, title, compensation and people.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's very possible to work with people that you admire and respect, but because the environment has been cultivated in a particular way you end up being miserable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are my values tolerated/respected in this environment, or will I have to suspend my values?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you safe? Will you grow?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quotes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job market is, unfortunately, fairly inefficient. We haven't figured out how to align job candidates with their prospective perfect job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may not know what we want, and the person posting the information...may not be describing the job well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you stray away from these principles, [finding a job] is going to get harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are really principles of working, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don't get jobs on their first shot, and you're probably not going to be an exception to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myths of Burnout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It makes you a bad worker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have to hate your company (or job, or manager, or coworker) to feel burned out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have to be overworking to become burned out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being burned out is a combination of factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a negative perspective on your work or workplace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't feel fulfilled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exhaustion. But doesn't have to mean you're overworking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 Red Flags&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your motivation is almost entirely external.&lt;br /&gt;
For example, you're only motivated by the money, or threat of losing your job. You're more likely to game the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You find it incredible difficult to focus.&lt;br /&gt;
Have more and more trouble focusing. Procrastinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your work is becoming progressively worse.&lt;br /&gt;
Not ups and downs, but always going down. This triggers a negative loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution? This episode doesn't go into depth, but notes that work needs to coexist with home in a balanced way. They need to enrich each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quotes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can feel that by becoming burnt out we've somehow done something wrong. That we've made the choice to feel burned out, or that everyone else has a longer fuse that us and we are somehow isolated in our feeling burned out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you set your hours at forty hours and you're exhausted at thirty-five, no matter how hard you try to not be exhausted, perhaps in spite of you trying to not be exhausted, you're likely to become even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody strives for burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our internal motivation is a much stronger motivator than external motivator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019-05-19 18:40&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a short, fast--almost blazing(heh)--version of a talk[^0] Jamie gave to a user's group about the history of web applications leading up to Blazor: .NET running in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which, as James Taylor says frequently, is nuts. But it's working. I'll leave you to listen to the nuts and bolts, but here's the top level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blazor is a .NET web frameowrk which runs in the browser.&lt;a id="fnref:1" href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blazor relies on WebAssembly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable target for compilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In summary, high level languages can be compiled down to WebAssembly and run in the browser at native speeds&amp;quot;&lt;a id="fnref:2" href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blazor was created by Steve Sanderson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blazor uses the Mono runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Weekly Sugar: When is Music a Distraction?</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.softwaremeadows.com/posts/weekly_sugar-_when_is_music_a_distraction_/images/fading-notes.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers often listen to music while programming. But, like teenagers who rock out when trying to do math homework, are we doing ourselves a favor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research so far shows that listening to music during &lt;em&gt;repetitive work&lt;/em&gt; can boost productivity. Fine if we're creating lots of classes that follow a pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about &lt;em&gt;creative or demanding cognitive work&lt;/em&gt; such as intensive debugging, having to hold a dozen dependencies in mind at once for thirty minutes? Then, music can be a serious distraction. Often, the best solution at those moments is to turn off the music, or use ambient/white noise to mask office sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers spend lots of time in demanding mental activity. Find music that doesn't distract you, and be mindful if it is. Change your music to change your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>"Yes or No?" -- A Classic and Effective Book For Decision-Making</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.softwaremeadows.com/posts/yes_or_no_a_classic_and_effective_book_for_decision_making/images/yes-or-no-logo.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1991, when I was working for Waldenbooks, we received an advanced reading copy of Dr Spencer Johnson's &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Yes-No-Guide-Better-Decisions/dp/0887306314/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=yes+or+no+johnson&amp;amp;qid=1558146718&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;&amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;No&amp;quot;: The Guide to Better Decisions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It became a treasured item for two reasons. One, I found it a terrifically practical decision-making method. Two, the advanced version was, in my opinion, &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than the published version. I'll explain the difference later, but first, about the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like others Dr Johnson authored or co-authored (&lt;em&gt;The One-Minute Manager&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Who Moved My Cheese?&lt;/em&gt;), the book is written in story/fable style. This was kind of the rage at the time, and in the wrong hands can be annoying. But in the case of &lt;em&gt;Yes or No&lt;/em&gt;, I never felt condescended to. It was clear that each page, each paragraph, was carefully thought out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is about a hundred pages long, with larger type, and will take you only about an hour to read. It could be one of the most valuable hours of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a summary of the system, which literally fits on a credit-sized card. The questions are so clearly designed that they don't really need explanation--but read the book anyway!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a tentative decision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask Three Practical Questions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Am I pursuing the real need?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Am I informed of my options?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have I thought this through to a better result?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask Three Private Questions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Am I really telling myself the truth?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does this decision really feel right to me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do my actions show I believe I deserve better?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If all six answers are Yes, proceed. If any answer is No, rethink the decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first three questions are &amp;quot;head&amp;quot; questions. They gather and analyze information. The second three questions are &amp;quot;heart&amp;quot; questions. They make you check in with your conscience and look &lt;em&gt;backward from your future self&lt;/em&gt; as if the tentative decision had already been made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first several times I applied the system it took awhile. But in time I started integrating the questions. I haven't gone strictly through the system in years, but I know I'm still influenced by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the lessons in the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My poor decisions are based on illusions I believe. My better decisions on realities I recognize.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I stop a poor decision to make a better decision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I use my head to ask probing questions, and my heart to find better answers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My decisions reveal my beliefs about my integrity, my intuition, and myself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once I see the truth, I make a better decision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My feelings often forecast my results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I get results I really believe I deserve.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are each our own guide to better decisions, and we can help others discover this for themselves.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What change did Johnson make in the final version, and why don't I like it? Here's the exact statement printed in the front matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.softwaremeadows.com/posts/yes_or_no_a_classic_and_effective_book_for_decision_making/images/front-matter.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I understand the impetus to streamline, I really think breaking down the questions leads to better answers. It forces the person to think about &lt;em&gt;each one&lt;/em&gt;, adding time and care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book has a handy wallet card, which I carried for years before it fell apart. Below is the original, followed by the published version. You can decide for yourself which you like!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and a final little story. My original copy of &lt;em&gt;Yes or No&lt;/em&gt; accidentally got wet, moldy, ucky. I finally let it go several months ago. Then, a week ago, I realized I wanted to reread the book and write a summary. My wife got me a copy through &lt;a href="http://www.paperbackswap.com/index.php"&gt;Paperback Swap&lt;/a&gt;. Imagine my surprise and great delight when what arrived in the mail was the advanced reading copy! That was a good decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Proposal: Combine Agile and Craftsmanship Manifestos into "Agile Crafted Software Values"</title>
      <description>&lt;style&gt;
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=IM+Fell+French+Canon|IM+Fell+French+Canon+SC');
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not combine the &lt;a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/"&gt;Agile Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/"&gt;Software Craftsmanship Manifeso&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's my suggestion, trying to remain faithful to the meaning, spirit, and brevity of the originals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="border: solid 5px lightgray; padding:10px; border-radius:8px"&gt;
&lt;h2 style="font-family:'IM Fell French Canon SC', serif; border:none; font-size:200%;"&gt;Agile Crafted Software Values&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div style="font-family:'IM Fell French Canon',serif; font-size:20px; margin-top:20px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An interacting community of professionals&lt;/strong&gt; over processes and tools&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well-crafted, working software&lt;/strong&gt; over comprehensive documentation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Productive collaboration and partnerships&lt;/strong&gt; over contract negotiation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responding to change by adding value&lt;/strong&gt; over following a plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we have found the items on the left to consistently yield greater benefits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="motivation"&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguably, the most influential document for modern software engineering is the 2001 Agile Manifesto, laying out the values and principles of what it means to develop in an effective way. It's easy to forget--or even not ever read--these principles, instead believing that they're enforced by the various methodologies. Several original signatories have rightly complained about what's happened to their vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agile has been taken over by corporations to make a buck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's important to remember two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agile is not a method. Methods should &lt;em&gt;implement&lt;/em&gt; agile values and principles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agile methods aren't for project management. They're for &lt;em&gt;software development&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, in 2009, Software Craftsmanship was proposed to reaffirm the central role of developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These shouldn't exist separately. By combining them, I think value is added.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Suggestion for Uncle Bob: Change "Software Craftsmanship" to "Crafted Software"</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.softwaremeadows.com/posts/suggestion_for_uncle_bob-_change_software_craftsmanship_to_crafted_software/images/640px-Salzburg_-_Violin_repair_shop_-_2910.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert &amp;quot;Uncle Bob&amp;quot; Martin has struggled with gender neutrality regarding the term &amp;quot;crafstman.&amp;quot; It's a difficult problem--English has a lack of neuters--and it's good he's struggling because it means he's listening to the very real affect of terminology on women in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2018/05/02/Craftsman-Craftswoman-Craftsperson.html"&gt;Craftsman, Craftswoman, Craftsperson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest flipping the syntax, so, not &amp;quot;software craftsmanship,&amp;quot; but &amp;quot;crafted software.&amp;quot; Likewise, we can eschew &amp;quot;craftsman&amp;quot; by using &amp;quot;crafter.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crafted Software&lt;/strong&gt; not Software Craftsmanship&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Software Crafter&lt;/strong&gt; not Software Craftsman, Craftswoman, Craftsperson&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Software Crafting&lt;/strong&gt; as in, &amp;quot;The discipline of software crafting&amp;quot; not &amp;quot;The discipline of software craftsmanship&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Craft&lt;/strong&gt; as in, &amp;quot;It's about craft&amp;quot; (or crafting) not &amp;quot;It's about craftsmanship&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using these terms has the added benefit of them being shorter, which I like. But maybe you're not into the whole brevity thing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Mixed Relationship with TDD</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.softwaremeadows.com/posts/my_mixed_relationship_with_tdd/images/tdd-created-by-nasa.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;OK, not completely &amp;quot;created by,&amp;quot; but &lt;a href="https://arialdomartini.wordpress.com/2012/07/20/you-wont-believe-how-old-tdd-is/"&gt;You won't believe how old TDD is&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="intro"&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a mixed relationship with Test-Driven Development (TDD). It's a valuable method that I've enjoyed--when I've used it. What matters more to me than test-first is creating automated tests early rather than late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite my on-again, off-again history with TDD, I've written about it in tutorial form. This series also includes examples of mocking and dependency injection. What to mock is, I think, especially difficult to get right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.softwaremeadows.com/posts/catching-up-on-coding-tdd-part-1/"&gt;Catching Up On Coding - TDD Part 1 | Software Meadows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.softwaremeadows.com/posts/catching-up-on-coding-tdd-part-2/"&gt;Catching Up On Coding - TDD Part 2 | Software Meadows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.softwaremeadows.com/posts/catching-up-on-coding-tdd-part-3/"&gt;Catching Up On Coding - TDD Part 3 | Software Meadows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="history"&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2001, at the beginning of the third millenium, I first learned about some eXtreme Programming (XP) practices, among them TDD. I wanted to try this out, but ran into a snag: Visual Basic 6 didn't have a good unit testing framework. &lt;a id="fnref:1" href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; So, I wrote my own. I also wrote it to test &lt;em&gt;private&lt;/em&gt; methods, because that's where the action was, and I hadn't yet wrapped my head around why testing public methods was key to keeping tests separate from code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even then, I got the TDDers thrill from seeing all green after running tests. However, my organization wasn't invested in TDD, so I set it aside. This was the story for the next couple of decades. The places I worked didn't care about more agile methods, and my efforts to introduce and use TDD didn't go far. Over time, I realized something else. My background in creative writing and music composition led me intuitively write code in a particular way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draft the code, getting some things working quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Significantly rewrite as the better structure reveals itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TDD didn't fit into this way of coding new projects, because my code would often change a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; as I settled on the most effective patterns. In business parlance, this is a &amp;quot;fail early, fail often&amp;quot; approach. Writing tests first at this stage worked against me because the methods I was testing were in flux. Heck, the whole approach was in flux. I could delete them at any moment. It took me a long time to reconcile how to integrate unit testing and TDD into my personal, fluid--and effective--style of coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One developer I talked with said his team didn't practice &amp;quot;test first,&amp;quot; but instead &amp;quot;test eventually.&amp;quot; I stored this tidbit away, though something nagged at me. How often was &amp;quot;test eventually&amp;quot; turning into &amp;quot;test never?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="database-testing"&gt;Database Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another obstacle on my road to successful unit testing was how to deal with databases. This wasn't just my obstacle, of course. It hung up loads of developers. The Repository Pattern was known, but not well-understood or encouraged in the Microsoft world. Abstracting the database seemed--and often was--tedious, time-consuming, and prohibitively maintenance-heavy. What kind of software was I writing all the time? Yep, database-centric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things didn't because easier with the adoption of Entity Framework (or Linq2Sql). When it came to testing, Microsoft's own documentation often recommended Repository Pattern, and sometimes Unit of Work.&lt;a id="fnref:2" href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This was frankly a mess. Why? Because EF was itself built using Repository (DbSet) and Unit of Work (DbContext) patterns.&lt;a id="fnref:3" href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; So, developers were writing &lt;em&gt;an abstraction on top of an abstraction&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I was hampered by a couple of things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a regular employee, I wasn't working in an agile environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a contractor, I was often constrained by client expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="today"&gt;Today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I've returned to TDD several times and have come to some tentative conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For me, on a greenfield project, test-first shouldn't be introduced immediately, but only after going through my drafting/iterating process to help clarify how &amp;quot;the code wants to be written&amp;quot; (I agree, a squishy, woo-woo statement.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After that, TDD is a big help, primarily because it forces tests to be written in parallel to coding &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; forces useful abstractions and separation of concerns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes, though, TDD needs to be set aside while a coding solution is explored via a deep dive. Avoid &lt;em&gt;premature testing&lt;/em&gt;. In these cases, the developer's mind needs to &lt;em&gt;flow&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Testing reveals architecture problems&lt;/em&gt;. This is another top value. In order for code to be testable, it needs to be well-architected using dependency injection and coding to interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm insisting on unit tests in my code, and forcing myself to use TDD in my workflow. This will require reading about modern TDD, and being confronted with terrific articles such as &lt;a href="http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2017/03/03/TDD-Harms-Architecture.html"&gt;TDD Harms Architecture&lt;/a&gt; by &amp;quot;Uncle Bob&amp;quot; Martin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="other-thoughts"&gt;Other Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="not-design"&gt;Not &amp;quot;Design&amp;quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TDD is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; design. Some people want the acronym to be Test Driven Design. But TDD isn't designing anything, except in the very loosest sense that programmers are always designing a method before coding it. We at least &lt;em&gt;imagine&lt;/em&gt; how it's going to work, and that's--again, loosely--design. Robert Martin says it emphatically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that the high level design and architecture of a system emerge from TDD is, frankly, absurd. Before you begin to code any software project, you need to have some architectural vision in place. TDD will not, and can not, provide this vision. That is not TDD’s role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And goes on to say&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this does not mean that designs do not emerge from TDD – they do; just not at the highest levels. The designs that emerge from TDD are one or two steps above the code;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="favorite-framework"&gt;Favorite Framework&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's easy. &lt;a href="https://xunit.net/"&gt;xUnit.net&lt;/a&gt;. I've loved it since its early days. Now, I've often used MSTest because it's A) built-in, and/or B) it's what the development shop was already using. But I prefer xUnit.net and its features such as Theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using one of the &amp;quot;Should&amp;quot;&lt;a id="fnref:4" href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; libraries makes unit testing even more readable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wrap-up"&gt;Wrap-Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing is hard. Unit testing is hard. But early, automated testing builds confidence in the system, and TDD provides a valuable feedback loop that stacks nicely on other methods such as continuous integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't quite true. There was a framework, but my misunderstanding of why only public methods should be tested interfered with me using it.&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-back-ref"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such as this untestable craziness: &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions/getting-started-with-ef-5-using-mvc-4/implementing-the-repository-and-unit-of-work-patterns-in-an-asp-net-mvc-application"&gt;Implementing the Repository and Unit of Work Patterns in an ASP.NET MVC Application (9 of 10) | Microsoft Docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-back-ref"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not until EF 4.1, and mocking wasn't easy-ish until 6.0.&lt;a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-back-ref"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/shouldly/shouldly"&gt;shouldly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://fluentassertions.com/"&gt;Fluent Assertions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-back-ref"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Don't Be a Lazy Programmer Like Matthew Jones Isn't</title>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://larrycuban.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/4505206e894208cab03f96c4703cac93.gif"  width=500 /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#examination"&gt;Examination&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#refutation"&gt;Refutation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#is-laziness-bad"&gt;Is Laziness Bad?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#then-what-is-matthew-jones"&gt;Then What is Matthew Jones?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew Jones recently wrote a blog article titled &lt;a href="https://exceptionnotfound.net/be-the-laziest-programmer-you-can-be/"&gt;Be The Laziest Programmer You Can Be&lt;/a&gt;. I like Matthew's articles, and I like this one in a way, but I'm going to make a case that Matthew's &lt;em&gt;completely wrong in his definition of lazy&lt;/em&gt;. This is one of those subjects that rankles me, kind of like computer people routinely misusing the word &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/deprecate?s=t"&gt;deprecate&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditional statemnent of Matthew's gist is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to find the most efficient way to do a job, give it to a lazy person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew states his thesis as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lazy programmers want to do as little work as possible right now.  But they also want to do as little &lt;em&gt;future&lt;/em&gt; work as possible,...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's absolutely right about the first part, doing as little work as possible right now. But he's absolutely wrong about the second, that lazy programmers are concerned about the future. They aren't, that's the problem. And, they're not efficient, they just get by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="examination"&gt;Examination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's hit the &lt;a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/lazy?s=t"&gt;dictionary&lt;/a&gt; first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;adjective&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;la·zi·er, la·zi·est.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;averse or disinclined to work, activity, or exertion; indolent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;causing idleness or indolence:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;a hot, lazy afternoon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;slow-moving; sluggish:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;a lazy stream&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(of a livestock brand) placed on its side instead of upright.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;verb (used without object)&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;la·zied, la·zy·ing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
5. to laze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Averse or disinclined to work.&amp;quot; This isn't decisive, because one could argue--as Matthew does--that a disincilation to work could extend toward future work. What does science have to say?  [Emphases mine]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person is being lazy if he is able to carry out some activity that he ought to carry out, but is disinclined to do so because of the effort involved. Instead, he carries out the activity perfunctorily; or engages in some other, less strenuous or less boring activity; or remains idle. In short, &lt;em&gt;he is being lazy if his motivation to spare himself effort trumps his motivation to do the right or expected thing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hide-and-seek/201410/the-psychology-laziness"&gt;The Psychology of Laziness | Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other aspects of laziness that are discussed in a brief review of the psychology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Procrastination&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Laziness and procrastination are similar in that they both involve a lack of motivation. But, &lt;em&gt;unlike a lazy person, a procrastinator aspires and intends to complete the task&lt;/em&gt; and, moreover, does eventually complete it, albeit at a higher cost to himself.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evolution&lt;/strong&gt;  Our nomadic ancestors had to conserve energy to compete for scarce resources and to fight or flee enemies and predators. Expending effort on anything other than short-term advantage could jeopardize their very survival.... &lt;em&gt;it made little sense to think long term&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effort and Reward&lt;/strong&gt;  &amp;quot;In most cases, it is deemed painful to expend effort on long-term goals that do not provide immediate gratification. For a person to embark on a project, he has to value the return on his labour more than his loss of comfort. &lt;em&gt;The problem is that he is disinclined to trust in a return that is both distant and uncertain&lt;/em&gt;. Because self-confident people are more apt to trust in the success and pay-off of their undertakings (and may even overestimate their likely returns), they are much more likely to overcome their natural laziness.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, from &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/contemporary-psychoanalysis-in-action/201510/7-reasons-why-laziness-is-myth"&gt;7 Reasons Why Laziness Is a Myth | Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear of failure.&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Many people get in their own way by postponing the pursuit of goals,&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear of success.&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;This cousin of the fear of failure is very real: Many people are unconsciously worried that they’ll succeed in ways potentially threatening to others. So they avoid conflict by not moving forward.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desire for nuture.&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;some of us don’t know how to ask for what we want directly—so we act useless as a way of getting others to do things for us.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear of expectations.&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;One of my patients rarely made plans and established herself as “lazy” so that other people would plan for her.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passive-aggresive communication.&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;People who avoid conflict often bury their dissatisfied feelings. They may communicate them indirectly through “laziness,” slacking in a way that will upset another person.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need for relaxation.&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Many people erroneously assume that they should always be going full steam, and chastise themselves for being “lazy” when their body and mind shut down in protest.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depression.&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;In criticizing himself for “laziness,” a man may miss signs that he is depressed and needs treatment.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This picture of laziness is much clearer. According to established social and science understandings, a lazy person:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoids doing hard work now, and so does the easiest thing he can get away with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isn't influenced by (or concerned with) future consequences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some attributes of a lazy developer&lt;a id="fnref:1" href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doesn't write thorough unit tests. Tests, if written, allow him to fit the requirement, but don't catch enough problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doesn't use consistent naming conventions. He uses whatever occurs to him at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only updates Scrum/project estimates and completions if pushed to do so, and probably days after the fact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makes no or cursory source control comments upon commit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Source code only works on his machine, unless he's been forced otherwise through continuous integration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="refutation"&gt;Refutation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is Matthew a &amp;quot;lazy&amp;quot; programmer? No, of course, not, but now I'm in for a pound so let's go through his article point-by-point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;why don't I hear you typing?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Matthew got in trouble for being lazy for not typing enough. This was a management failure, pure and simple. And it's proven by the company having an overtime-oriented culture. I'll bet &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; were lazy because they weren't planning ahead, as Matthew was. That guy was wrong and a jerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lazy programmers are &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; programmers.  They don't do more work than absolutely necessary.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. The confusion here is in the word &amp;quot;necessary.&amp;quot; For Matthew, &amp;quot;necessary&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;do it right so we reduce doing it again.&amp;quot; Lazy programmers define &amp;quot;necessary&amp;quot; as &amp;quot;required by something external.&amp;quot; Let me call this one out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refactoring doesn't exist for the lazy programmer. It's not in his vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lazy programmers abhor redundancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just the opposite. A lazy programmer will copy/paste code all day, because he's a) finishing more work &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;, and b) doesn't expect to have to fix the code later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lazy programmers explain their decisions.  They write thorough comments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope. Lazy programmers, concerned only with the present, see explanations as a waste of time. &amp;quot;Working&amp;quot; code should be good enough, they reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lazy programmer is not attached to his future self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lazy programmers automate everything that can possibly be automated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would take foresight. I've seen this repeatedly, programmers who are too lazy to encapsulate a method, or write a utility to automate. They'll instead do it the long, hard way every time. Their justification? &amp;quot;Writing that utility will take too long!&amp;quot; (This thinking is further exacerbated by deadline-oriented management.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lazy programmers teach people more junior than them, partially so those junior people can do the work instead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half of this is right. Lazy programmers want to get other people doing their work. But the way they do it is to claim they're too busy to fix their own code, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; too busy to explain clearly, so &lt;em&gt;just figure it out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lazy programmers expect to be replaced.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, they &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; expect this, but are not only surprised when it happens, but also angry, because they think they're doing what was expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be lazy. It's OK.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it isn't, because you're not. Programmers!, don't conflate laziness with other problems. And don't beat yourselves up, either! Get help with beliefs and root causes. Learn to value strategic thinking, to give yourself a positive boost about creating that automation utility. To see your future self grinning like mad and saying &amp;quot;This used to take the other guy four hours. I automated it and it's done in four minutes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It [laziness] takes practice,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be pretty clear by now, but lazy people don't practice. I play violin. I'm prety good. But one reason I don't play violin really, really well is because I only practiced enough to get by. (I also didn't know about &lt;a href="https://jamesclear.com/deliberate-practice-theory"&gt;deliberate practice&lt;/a&gt;, but that's another story.) A lazy person, by definition, avoids effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excellence requires continual effort&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="is-laziness-bad"&gt;Is Laziness Bad?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Well, maybe. The behavior's not helpful, and often harmful. The thing is, lazy &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; aren't bad. It's &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a disease, and it's &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a character or moral defect. As noted above, there are people who get huge amounts done, but if they rest they demean themselves as lazy. That's unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laziness is a habit. And &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=atomic+habits&amp;amp;qid=1555604333&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-2"&gt;habits can be broken&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="then-what-is-matthew-jones"&gt;Then What is Matthew Jones?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's pretty easy. Matthew is an &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;effective developer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. All of the positive traits he ascribes to laziness are in fact hallmarks of high-performing software engineers. Matthew:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is concerned with how his current actions impact his future self.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is likewise concerned with making his code easier for other developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plans. Then executes. Then &lt;em&gt;reviews and improves&lt;/em&gt;. He practices &lt;em&gt;kaizen&lt;/em&gt;. He refactors mercilessly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coaches others and, I hope, is always willing to be confronted with opposition, otherwise I probably wouldn't have taken the time to write all this down. Because, Matthew...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is wrong about what it means to be a lazy programmer, and I hope he revises his pitch. It's great to help programmers not be lazy, but I don't think redefining a word to mean its opposite is a good idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew, I have a feeling I'd like you if we sat down for a beer. If you're ever in Denver, let's find out. You take your craft seriously, and have a light-hearted writing voice. It's from that mindset that I'm telling you, firmly, kindly: Matthew, buddy, you are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a lazy programmer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry that these are all in the masculine. Unfortunately, 90% of programmers are guys, so I'm writing to the majority audience.&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-back-ref"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Personal Reflections on Removing Distractions for Improved Productivity</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.softwaremeadows.com/posts/personal_reflections_on_removing_distractions_for_improved_productivity/images/reflection.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've done a couple of experiments with reducing distractions
(&lt;a href="https://www.flattland.com/posts/month_of_mu_week_1/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.softwaremeadows.com/posts/a_week_of_web_blocking_for_productivity_and_well-being/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Since then, I've taken the weed-whacker to Facebook, only check the news a couple of times a day, and (try to) restrict my Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for me professionally and personally?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="facebook"&gt;Facebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I don't miss Facebook one bit. The research is pretty clear that social media &lt;a href="(https://hbr.org/2017/04/a-new-more-rigorous-study-confirms-the-more-you-use-facebook-the-worse-you-feel)"&gt;makes us unhappy&lt;/a&gt;. What alarms me in retrospect is that Facebook use seems like an addiction: something bad for you, but you can't stop doing. Consider these stats from a recent &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/poll-americans-give-social-media-clear-thumbs-down-n991086"&gt;NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll&lt;/a&gt; on social media usage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;69% of adults in the US said &amp;quot;they use such services at least once a day.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And yet, &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;82% of Americans believe social media is a waste of time.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;57% said social media &amp;quot;does more to divide us.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;55% said &amp;quot;social media does more to spread lies and falsehoods.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been pretty careful for a long time about what services I sign up for. I can't deny the influence of Twitter, but I never understood the appeal of reading people's mundane, off-the-cuff thoughts, or publishing my own. I never signed up. Likewise, no SnapChat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, I only had Facebook to deal with. I was a little worried about losing contact with my FB friends, but realized a) I only had about thirty FB friends, and b) that worry was a &lt;em&gt;symptom of the FB disease&lt;/em&gt;. The solution was easy, I asked all my FB friends via instant messenger if they'd give me their email addresses so I could stay in touch. Many did. Anxiety-crisis averted. I backed up and deleted my account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What now? That's easy, too. How about I make more &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;, in-person friends? You know, the kind that research shows actually increase well-being?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="news"&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news is inherently depressing, and apparently &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140728-why-is-all-the-news-bad"&gt;we love it&lt;/a&gt;. Even as a kid (back in the three-network days), I hated watching or listening to the TV news because it sounded ugly. This doesn't mean news isn't important. But there's only so much reporting of the current socio-political awfulness a person should read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used a browser blocker to keep me from reading the news during the day for several weeks. I'm pretty good now at only dipping into Google News and NPR a couple of times a day. I know from past experience I can go weeks at a time without checking the news because if something really, really important happens I'm sure I'll hear about it. Here's the way I now see being a news junkie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news is like Facebook. Emotionally, it's more like gossip, and is addictive in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is, I can't do much, if anything, about what's in the news. So why obsess and clamor and complain over what I can't change, when I can fill my life with plenty that I can?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="netflix-et-al"&gt;Netflix, et al&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my bane. Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, CWTV, IMDb FreeDive, YouTube...I'm still addicted to streaming media. It's not wrong for me to enjoy a little TV and movies, but it's too often a go-to break from work or other activities. Is this bad? Yep, for the same reasons as above. It keeps me away from real, live social interactions. There's also evidence that watching TV has negative mental effects, while reading has positive effects. (Sorry, I don't have a link to this right now.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current solution to this is strict time-blocking. I try to only watch Netflix during certain times of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know when I'm watching too much TV. I can feel it, and that's compounded by my profession as a software engineer. My job is at the computer, so all together I can end up spending sixteen hours a day on the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="meditation-woop-time-boxing-habits-whew"&gt;Meditation, WOOP, Time-Boxing, Habits: Whew!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removing distractions has helped my productivity and well-being. But it's not enough. To create a healthier work balance, I needed to retrain my brain. Fortunately, we live in a great time for research into well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meditation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Proper meditation, where the wandering mind (the Default Mental Network) is stilled, helps not only with mental/emotional health but also distraction. After all, the wandering mind &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WOOP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is a great technique for establishing new behaviors and habits. It can be done daily in a few minutes. I've used this to manage overwhelm when facing a large task list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify what you &lt;strong&gt;W&lt;/strong&gt;ish for (the goal)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imagine and emotionally invest in the &lt;strong&gt;O&lt;/strong&gt;utcome(s). It's valuable to imagine the affect on the future self.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imagine and emotionally invest in the &lt;strong&gt;O&lt;/strong&gt;bstacle(s). Again, what's the affect on the future self?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a simple If-Then &lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt;lan. &amp;quot;When this happens, I will do this.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Do not &amp;quot;flip the Os&amp;quot;. Imagine outcomes first, then obstacles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time-Boxing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I've adopted a 50-10 time box. &lt;a href="https://www.softwaremeadows.com/posts/the_50-10_time_box_revising_pomodoro_for_software_development/"&gt;Read my blog article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There are great books on how to break and make habits, based on science. For those who love podcasts, here's an &lt;a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/building-breaking-habits/"&gt;interview with the author of Atomic Habits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-reflections"&gt;Final Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had to overcome some challenges in the past couple of years. Thankfully, I have a wife who loves me, and my clients have been happy with my work. I enjoy reading about science and well-being, and enjoy even more &lt;em&gt;applying&lt;/em&gt; what I learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, my experiments have been a success.&lt;/p&gt;
