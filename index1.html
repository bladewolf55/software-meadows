<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p><strong>Quotes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beginning in late 2013, we embarked on a four-year research journey to investigate what capabilities and practices are important to accelerate the development and delivery of software and, in turn, value to companies.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="chapter-1-accelerate">Chapter 1 - Accelerate</h2>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>Companies, even big ones, are moving away from big projects, instead using small teams using small development cycles.</p>
<p>Software is at the heart of (most of) these transformations. [I don't personally believe that software is the end-all of business improvement, but it's true that many businesses don't realize how much software drives them.]</p>
<p>Maturity models don't work. Capability models do.</p>
<p>None of these factors predict performance:</p>
<ul>
<li>age and technology used for the application (for example, mainframe “systems of record” vs. greenfield “systems of engagement”)</li>
<li>whether operations teams or development teams performed deployments</li>
<li>whether a change approval board (CAB) is implemented</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quotes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>DevOps emerged from a small number of organizations facing a wicked problem: how to build secure, resilient, rapidly evolving distributed systems at scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A recent Forrester (Stroud et al. 2017) report found that 31% of the industry is not using practices and principles that are widely considered to be necessary for accelerating technology transformations, such as continuous integration and continuous delivery, Lean practices, and a collaborative culture (i.e., capabilities championed by the DevOps movement).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Another Forrester report states that DevOps is accelerating technology, but that organizations often overestimate their progress (Klavens et al. 2017). Furthermore, the report points out that executives are especially prone to overestimating their progress when compared to those who are actually doing the work.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To summarize, in 2017 we found that, when compared to low performers, the high performers have:</p>
<ul>
<li>46 times more frequent code deployments</li>
<li>440 times faster lead time from commit to deploy</li>
<li>170 times faster mean time to recover from downtime</li>
<li>5 times lower change failure rate (1/5 as likely for a change to fail)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="chapter-2-measuring-performance">Chapter 2 - Measuring Performance</h2>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>The academic rigor of this book is exceptionally high.</p>
<p>Three ways to masure performance that don't work: lines of code, velocity, and utilization.</p>
<p>Two characteristics of successful measures: focus on global outcomes, and focus on outcomes not output.</p>
<p>Lead Time is &quot;the time it takes to go from a customer making a request to the request being satisfied.&quot; The authors focused on the delivery part of lead time--&quot;the time it takes for work to be implemented, tested, and delivered.&quot;</p>
<p>The stats on &quot;the impact of delivery perofrmance on organization performance&quot; shows that software development and IT are not cost centers; they can provide a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>It's important to distinguish between strategic and non-strategic software. Strategic software should be kept in-house. See Simon Wardley and the Wardley mapping method.</p>
<p><strong>Quotes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are many frameworks and methodologies that aim to improve the way we build software products and services. We wanted to discover what works and what doesn’t in a scientific way,...</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of these measurements focus on productivity. In general, they suffer from two drawbacks. First, they focus on outputs rather than outcomes. Second, they focus on individual or local measures rather than team or global ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In our search for measures of delivery performance that meet these criteria, we settled on four: delivery lead time, deployment frequency, time to restore service, and change fail rate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Astonishingly, these results demonstrate that there is no tradeoff between improving performance and achieving higher levels of stability and quality. Rather, high performers do better at all of these measures. This is precisely what the Agile and Lean movements predict,...</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s worth noting that the ability to take an experimental approach to product development is highly correlated with the technical practices that contribute to continuous delivery.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The fact that software delivery performance matters provides a strong argument against outsourcing the development of software that is strategic to your business, and instead bringing this capability into the core of your organization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The measurement tools can be used by any organization,...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, it is essential to use these tools carefully. In organizations with a learning culture, they are incredibly powerful. But “in pathological and bureaucratic organizational cultures, measurement is used as a form of control, and people hide information that challenges existing rules, strategies, and power structures. As Deming said, 'whenever there is fear, you get the wrong numbers'”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="chapter-3-measuring-and-changing-culture">Chapter 3 - Measuring and Changing Culture</h2>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>Not only is culture measurable for the purposes of the book, but the authors learned that DevOps can &quot;influence and improve culture.&quot;</p>
<p>Westrum's three characteristics of good information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provides the needed answers</li>
<li>Timely</li>
<li>Presented so can be used effectively</li>
</ol>
<p>A good culture:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires trust and cooperation</li>
<li>Has higher quality decisionpmaking</li>
<li>Teams do better job with their people</li>
</ul>
<p>John Shook, in a video on the Lean Transformation Model, makes it clear that the approach is value-driven approach, the &quot;true north&quot; of any situation. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEcdliWZH30">John Shook Explains the Lean Transformation Model - YouTube</a></p>
<p><strong>Quotes</strong></p>
<p>Ron Westrum's three kinds of organizational culture</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pathological</strong> (power-oriented) organizations are characterized by large amounts of fear and threat. People often hoard information or withhold it for political reasons, or distort it to make themselves look better.<br />
<strong>Bureaucratic</strong> (rule-oriented) organizations protect departments. Those in the department want to maintain their “turf,” insist on their own rules, and generally do things by the book — their book.<br />
<strong>Generative</strong> (performance-oriented) organizations focus on the mission. How do we accomplish our goal? Everything is subordinated to good performance, to doing what we are supposed to do.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-4-technical-practices">Chapter 4 - Technical Practices</h2>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>CD practices will help improve culture. However, implementing the practices &quot;often requires rethinking everything&quot;.</p>
<p>Keeping system and application configuration in version control is <em>more important</em> to delivery performance than keeping code in version control. (But both are important).</p>
<p><strong>Quotes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Continuous delivery is a set of capabilities that enable us to get changes of all kinds — features, configuration changes, bug fixes, experiments — into production or into the hands of users safely, quickly, and sustainably. There are five key principles at the heart of continuous delivery:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Build Quality In</strong><br />
Invest in building a culture supported by tools and people where we can detect any issues quickly, so that they can be fixed straight away when they are cheap to detect and resolve.</li>
<li><strong>Work in Small Batches</strong><br />
By splitting work up into much smaller chunks that deliver measurable business outcomes quickly for a small part of our target market, we get essential feedback on the work we are doing so that we can course correct.</li>
<li><strong>Computers perform repetitive tasks; people solve problems</strong><br />
One important strategy to reduce the cost of pushing out changes is to take repetitive work that takes a long time, such as regression testing and software deployments, and invest in simplifying and automating this work.</li>
<li><strong>Relentlessly pursue continuous improvement</strong><br />
The most important characteristic of high-performing teams is that they are never satisfied: they always strive to get better.</li>
<li><strong>Everyone is responsible</strong><br />
in bureaucratic organizations teams tend to focus on departmental goals rather than organizational goals. Thus, development focuses on throughput, testing on quality, and operations on stability. However, in reality these are all system-level outcomes, and they can only be achieved by close collaboration between everyone involved in the software delivery process. A key objective for management is making the state of these system-level outcomes transparent, working with the rest of the organization to set measurable, achievable, time-bound goals for these outcomes, and then helping their teams work toward them.</li>
</ol>
<p>A key goal of continuous delivery is changing the economics of the software delivery process so the cost of pushing out individual changes is very low.</p>
<p>In order to implement continuous delivery, we must create the following foundations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comprehensive configuration management</strong><br />
It should be possible to provision our environments and build, test, and deploy our software in a fully automated fashion purely from information stored in version control.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous integration</strong><br />
High-performing teams keep branches short-lived (less than one day’s work) and integrate them into trunk/master frequently. Each change triggers a build process that includes running unit tests. If any part of this process fails, developers fix it immediately.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous testing</strong><br />
Automated unit and acceptance tests should be run against every commit to version control to give developers fast feedback on their changes. Developers should be able to run all automated tests on their workstations in order to triage and fix defects.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Implementing continuous delivery means creating multiple feedback loops to ensure that high-quality software gets delivered to users more frequently and more reliably.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="chapter-5-architecture">Chapter 5 - Architecture</h2>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>See the quote below, it's important that <em>teams</em> be loosely coupled, not just the architecture. But how does this apply to a small software/IT shop of, say a half dozen employees?</p>
<p>I see autonomy of teams coming up quite a bit, not having to ask for permission to change from someone outside the team, and also that changes don't strongly affect other teams. This is a result of loose-coupling.</p>
<p>So, it's interesting that good information flow is important, but that teams shouldn't need to overly communicate in order to do their work.</p>
<p>The authors make a great point about service-oriented architecture and microservices, that these both can enable the desired outcome of testability, <em>but</em>, they don't guarantee it. The team has to be vigilant about ensuring the ability to independently test services.</p>
<p>A good, loosely-coupled architecture allows not just the software but the teams to scale. Contrary to  assumptions, adding employees <em>when there's a proper software/team architecture</em> leads to <em>increasing</em> deployment frequency.</p>
<p>I've been in the camp that wants to reduce or at least make tooling consistent. I think there's still some value in that from a maintainability perspective. However, using the better tool for the job apparently has more value. I don't think the authors are advocating a gung-ho or cavalier approach, though.</p>
<p><strong>Quotes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We found that high performance is possible with all kinds of systems, provided that systems—and the teams that build and maintain them—are loosely coupled.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We discovered that low performers were more likely to say that the software they were building—or the set of services they had to interact with—was custom software developed by another company (e.g., an outsourcing partner).... In the rest of the cases, there was no significant correlation between system type and delivery performance. We found this surprising: we had expected teams working on packaged software, systems of record, or embedded systems to perform worse, and teams working on systems of engagement and greenfield systems to perform better. The data shows that this is not the case.</p>
<p>This reinforces the importance of focusing on the architectural <em>characteristics</em>, discussed below, rather than the implementation details of your architecture.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who agreed with the following statements were more likely to be in the high-performing group:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can do most of our testing without requiring an integrated environment.</li>
<li>We can and do deploy or release our application independently of other applications / services it depends on.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal is for your architecture to support the ability of teams to get their work done — from design through to deployment — without requiring high-bandwidth communication between teams.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When teams can decide which tools they use, it contributes to software delivery performance and, in turn, to organizational performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That said, there is a place for standardization, particularly around the architecture and configuration of infrastructure.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Another finding in our research is that teams that build security into their work also do better at continuous delivery. A key element of this is ensuring that information security teams make preapproved, easy-to-consume libraries, packages, toolchains, and processes available for developers and IT operations to use in their work.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Architects should focus on engineers and outcomes, not tools or technologies.... What tools or technologies you use is irrelevant if the people who must use them hate using them, or if they don’t achieve the outcomes and enable the behaviors we care about. What is important is enabling teams to make changes to their products or services without depending on other teams or systems.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-6-integrating-infosec-into-the-delivery-lifecyle">Chapter 6 - Integrating InfoSec Into the Delivery Lifecyle</h2>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>InfoSec is everyone's responsiblity.</p>
<p>Don't leave security reviews until the end of development. Security is equal to Development and Operations.</p>
<p><strong>Quotes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>many developers are ignorant of common security risks, such as the OWASP Top 10</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We found that when teams “shift left” on information security — that is, when they build it into the software delivery process instead of making it a separate phase that happens downstream of the development process — this positively impacts their ability to practice continuous delivery.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, security reviews are conducted for all major features, and this review process is performed in such a way that it doesn’t slow down the development process.</li>
<li>the second aspect of this capability: information security should be integrated into the entire software delivery lifecycle from development through operations.</li>
<li>Finally, we want to make it easy for developers to do the right thing when it comes to infosec.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We found that high performers were spending 50% less time remediating security issues than low performers.</p>

<li>Limiting work in progress (WIP), and using these limits to drive process improvement and increase throughput</li>
<li>Creating and maintaining visual displays showing key quality and productivity metrics and the current status of work (including defects), making these visual displays available to both engineers and leaders, and aligning these metrics with operational goals</li>
<li>Using data from application performance and infrastructure monitoring tools to make business decisions on a daily basis</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>WIP limits on their own do not strongly predict delivery performance. It’s only when they’re combined with the use of visual displays and have a feedback loop from production monitoring tools back to delivery teams or the business that we see a strong effect.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We found that approval only for high-risk changes was not correlated with software delivery performance. Teams that reported no approval process or used peer review achieved higher software delivery performance. Finally, teams that required approval by an external body achieved lower performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We found that external approvals were negatively correlated with lead time, deployment frequency, and restore time, and had no correlation with change fail rate. In short, approval by an external body (such as a manager or CAB) <em>simply doesn’t work</em> to increase the stability</p>

<p>Lean Product Development</p>
<ul>
<li>Work in Small Batches</li>
<li>Make Flow of Work Visible</li>
<li>Gather and Implement Customer Feedback</li>
<li>Team Experimentation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quotes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We wanted to test whether these [Lean] practices have a direct impact on organizational performance, measured in terms of productivity, market share, and profitability.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The extent to which teams slice up products and features into small batches that can be completed in less than a week and released frequently, including the use of MVPs (minimum viable products).</li>
<li>Whether teams have a good understanding of the flow of work from the business all the way through to customers, and whether they have visibility into this flow, including the status of products and features.</li>
<li>Whether organizations actively and regularly seek customer feedback and incorporate this feedback into the design of their products.</li>
<li>Whether development teams have the authority to create and change specifications as part of the development process without requiring approval.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s worth noting that an experimental approach to product development is highly correlated with the technical practices that contribute to continuous delivery.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-9-making-work-sustainable">Chapter 9 - Making Work Sustainable</h2>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quotes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We call this deployment pain, and it is important to measure because it highlights the friction and disconnect that exist between the activities used to develop and test software and the work done to maintain and keep software operational. This is where development meets IT operations, and it is where there is the greatest potential for differences: in environment, in process and methodology, in mindset, and even in the words teams use to describe the work they do.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>where code deployments are most painful, you’ll find the poorest software delivery performance, organizational performance, and culture.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Before implementing the technical practices and discipline of continuous delivery on the Bing team, engineers reported work/life balance satisfaction scores of just 38%. After implementing these technical practices, the scores jumped to 75%.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>if deployments have to be performed outside of normal business hours, that’s a sign of architectural problems that should be addressed. It’s entirely possible — given sufficient investment — to build complex, large-scale distributed systems which allow for fully automated deployments with zero downtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fundamentally, most deployment problems are caused by a complex, brittle deployment process. This is typically the result of three factors.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, software is often not written with deployability in mind.</li>
<li>Second, the probability of a failed deployment rises substantially when manual changes must be made to production environments as part of the deployment process.</li>
<li>Finally, complex deployments often require multiple handoffs between teams, particularly in siloed organizations where database administrators, network administrators, systems administrators, infosec, testing/QA, and developers all work in separate teams.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to reduce deployment pain, we should: Build systems that are designed to be deployed easily into multiple environments, can detect and tolerate failures in their environments, and can have various components of the system updated independently Ensure that the state of production systems can be reproduced (with the exception of production data) in an automated fashion from information in version control Build intelligence into the application and the platform so that the deployment process can be as simple as possible</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Burnout is physical, mental, or emotional exhaustion caused by overwork or stress — but it is more than just being overworked or stressed. Burnout can make the things we once loved about our work and life seem insignificant and dull. It often manifests itself as a feeling of helplessness, and is correlated with pathological cultures and unproductive, wasteful work.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Job stress also affects employers, costing the US economy $ 300 billion per year in sick time, long-term disability, and excessive job turnover (Maslach 2014). Thus, employers have both a duty of care toward employees and a fiduciary obligation to ensure staff do not become burned out.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Technology managers, like so many other well-meaning managers, often try to fix the person while ignoring the work environment,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>six organizational risk factors that predict burnout (Leiter and Maslach 2008):</p>
<ol>
<li>Work overload: job demands exceed human limits.</li>
<li>Lack of control: inability to influence decisions that affect your job.</li>
<li>Insufficient rewards: insufficient financial, institutional, or social rewards.</li>
<li>Breakdown of community: unsupportive workplace environment.</li>
<li>Absence of fairness: lack of fairness in decision-making processes.</li>
<li>Value conflicts: mismatch in organizational values and the individual’s values.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Our own research tells us which organizational factors are most strongly correlated with high levels of burnout, and suggests where to look for solutions. The five most highly correlated factors are:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is important to note that the organizational values we mention here are the real, actual, lived organizational values felt by employees. If the organizational values felt by employees differ from the official values of the organization — the mission statements printed on pieces of paper or even on placards — it will be the everyday, lived values that count. If there is a values mismatch — either between an employee and their organization, or between the organization’s stated values and their actual values — burnout will be a concern. When there is alignment, employees will thrive.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-10-employee-satisfaction-identity-and-engagement">Chapter 10 - Employee Satisfaction, Identity, and Engagement</h2>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quotes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We found that employees in high-performing teams were 2.2 times more likely to recommend their organization to a friend as a great place to work, and 1.8 times more likely to recommend their team to a friend. This is a significant finding, as research has shown that “companies with highly engaged workers grew revenues two and a half times as much as those with low engagement levels.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To measure this, we asked people the extent to which they agreed with the following statements (adapted from Kankanhalli et al. 2005): I am glad I chose to work for this organization rather than another company. I talk of this organization to my friends as a great company to work for. I am willing to put in a great deal of effort beyond what is normally expected to help my organization be successful. I find that my values and my organization’s values are very similar. In general, the people employed by my organization are working toward the same goal. I feel that my organization cares about me.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Our analysis is clear: in today’s fast-moving and competitive world, the best thing you can do for your products, your company, and your people is institute a culture of experimentation and learning, and invest in the technical and management capabilities that enable it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In fact, our measure of job satisfaction looks at a few key things: if you are satisfied in your work, if you are given the tools and resources to do your work, and if your job makes good use of your skills and abilities. It’s important to call these out, because taken together, this is what makes job satisfaction so impactful.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Automation matters because it gives over to computers the things computers are good at — rote tasks that require no thinking and that in fact are done better when you don’t think too much about them. Since humans are so bad at these kinds of tasks, turning them over to computers allows people to focus on the things they’re good at: weighing the evidence, thinking through problems, and making decisions. Being able to apply one’s judgment and experience to challenging problems is a big part of what makes people satisfied with their work.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Diversity matters. Research shows that teams with more diversity with regard to gender or underrepresented minorities are smarter (Rock and Grant 2016), achieve better team performance (Deloitte 2013), and achieve better business outcomes (Hunt et al. 2015).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is also important to note that diversity is not enough. Teams and organizations must also be inclusive. An inclusive organization is one where “all organizational members feel welcome and valued for who they are and what they ’ bring to the table. ’ All stakeholders share a high sense of belonging and fulfilled mutual purpose” (Smith and Lindsay 2014, p. 1). Inclusion must be present in order for diversity to take hold.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a study conducted by Anita Woolley and Thomas W. Malone measured group intelligence and found that teams with more women tended to fall above average on the collective intelligence scale (Woolley and Malone 2011). Despite all of these clear advantages, organizations are failing to recruit and retain women in technical fields.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Women and underrepresented minorities report harassment, microaggressions, and unequal pay (e.g., Mundy 2017). These are all things we can actively watch for and improve as leaders and peers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="chapter-11-leaders-and-managers">Chapter 11 - Leaders and Managers</h2>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We (developers) don't like managers who get in the way, but we recognize that good leaders make a positive difference toward success.</li>
</ul>
<p>Five Characteristics of a transformational leader:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vision</strong>. Has a clear understanding of where the organization is going and where it should be in five years.</li>
<li><strong>Inspirational communication</strong>. Communicates in a way that inspires and motivates, even in an uncertain or changing environment.</li>
<li><strong>Intellectual stimulation</strong>. Challenges followers to think about problems in new ways.</li>
<li><strong>Supportive leadership</strong>. Demonstrates care and consideration of followers’ personal needs and feelings.</li>
<li><strong>Personal recognition</strong>. Praises and acknowledges achievement of goals and improvements in work quality; personally compliments others when they do outstanding work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Transformative leadership helps, but it isn't enough. &quot;They need their teams executing the work on a suitable architecture, with good technical practices, use of Lean principles, and all the other factors that we’ve studied over the years.&quot;
It's interesting that leaders don't have to be managers, and vice-versa. When managers <em>are</em> leaders, that's very powerful.</p>
<p><em>Managers should make performance metrics visible and aligned with organizational goals</em></p>
<p><strong>Prioritize working on technical debt.</strong></p>
<p>Tips:</p>
<p>Enable cross-functional collaborations by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building trust with yoru counterparts on other teams.</li>
<li>Encouraging pracitioners to move between departments.</li>
<li>Actively seeking, encouraing, and rewarding work that facilitates collaboration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Help create a climate of learning by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a training budget and advocating for it internally.</li>
<li>Ensuring that your team has the resources to engage in informal learning and the space to explore ideas.</li>
<li>Making it safe to fail.</li>
<li>Creating opportunities and spaces to share information.</li>
<li>Encourage sharing and innovation by having demo days and forums.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make effective use of tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your team can choose their tools.
<blockquote>
<p>If your organization must standardize tools, ensure that procurement and finance are acting in the interests of teams, not the other way around.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Make monitoring a priority.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quotes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A good leader affects a team’s ability to deliver code, architect good systems, and apply Lean principles to how the team manages its work and develops products. All of these have a measurable impact on an organization’s profitability, productivity, and market share.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Servant leaders focus on their followers’ development and performance, whereas transformational leaders focus on getting followers to identify with the organization and engage in support of organizational objectives.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Though we often hear stories of DevOps and technology transformation success coming from the grassroots, it is far easier to achieve success when you have leadership support.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Our research shows that three things are highly correlated with software delivery performance and contribute to a strong team culture: cross-functional collaboration, a climate for learning, and tools.</p>

<h2 id="why-am-i-writing-this">Why Am I Writing This?</h2>
<p>I recently had a delightful meeting with a 29-year-old violinist who is making a career change into software. She's brim-full of ideas and excitement, has an entrepeneurial spirit, and is doing something very smart: asking other people what they think. She's going to get loads of advice, most of it well-meaning crap, which could very well include my information.</p>
<p>Her story spoke to me, because I'm a violinist, I got my first IT job when I was thirty, and I've been successfully self-employed. I've struggled with everything I'm suggesting.</p>
<p>What interested me was how to answer a question: <em>What do I think a beginning software engineer needs to know?</em></p>
<p>The answer has almost nothing to do with programming. Oh, sure, I could list a whole bunch of programming resources that even I haven't read. But she'll eventually find those. What I think, based on twenty-five years of experience in the industry (plus fifteen years in retail, food service, and other jobs before that), is that a successful, fulfilled <strong>person</strong> needs to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn how to learn</li>
<li>Know what it means to know something</li>
<li>Communicate well as a collaborator</li>
<li>Savor life</li>
</ol>
<p>Are there skills specific to being a programmer? Sure. See <a href="#appendix-a-skills-i-think-a-software-developers-needs-to-cultivate">Appendix A</a>. But I think they don't matter without the basic human stuff. You're not going to find (much) fluff below, because one of my mottos is &quot;show me the science.&quot;</p>

If this summary isn't clear enough, find another one. There are lots out there. I don't think you need to buy the book, but it's easy to find used. In my view, Allen's crucial messages are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get everything you want to do out of your head and into a <em>system you trust</em>.</li>
<li>The purpose of a personal productivity system is to <em>reduce stress</em>.</li>

I know this is four things. But really, watch this. It's over an hour, and completely worth it. Dr Pausch was diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer. He delivers a heartfelt talk that would shame any &quot;motivational speaker,&quot; because he's not motivated by fame or money since he, at the time, had only a few months to live.</p>

<p><em>Business Plans</em><br />
In my meeting, I was asked about business plans. I have limited experience writing a business plan, and I knew there'd be plenty of resources available online, such as those listed.</p>
<p>Here's my opinion: unless you're seeking investors or a loan, the point of working on a business plan is to get you thinking, and to prepare for conversations with other professionals. This quote sums that up nicely.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-a-skills-i-think-software-developers-need-to-cultivate">Appendix A - Skills (I Think) Software Developers Need to Cultivate</h2>
<p>Sorry, I know I'm all about evidence, but I haven't researched this. Here is my opinion on skills/traits specific to software development.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Puzzle/problem solving</strong>. Programmers have to be able to solve problems. In my opinion, the very best are interested in how to solve problems multiple ways, and never think they have the only right answer.</li>
<li><strong>Tenacity</strong>. Programmers are faced with tasks that take hours, days, or months to accomplish. They face problems that often don't have obvious or simple answers. They have to keep after it. And they're sitting in a chair, which is completely unhealthy.</li>
<li><strong>Abstract thinking</strong>. This is a fact, because software is an abstraction. Programming is one of the few fields where what you see is <em>not</em> what you get. Developers stare at words that are instructions later interpreted to produce something someone sees. It's not natural or easy. Imagine your job was to describe, in braille, how to write an English document that explained all the steps to painting Van Gogh's <em>Starry Night</em>, and if the painting doesn't look right the braille book doesn't open.</li>
<li><strong>Communicating complexity simply</strong>. On a scale of 1 to 10, most programmers reach about a 2 on this. A program is like a night at the theater (or movie, or symphony). You, the audience (manager, user) have no idea what it took to create. It looks simple, it must have been. Developers, especially seniors, must be able to explain how something seemingly simple will work, and why it will take a year to do it.</li>
<li><strong>Understand everyone else's job</strong>. Scale of 1 to 10: most programmers are a 3 (but think they're a 7). This really depends on what area of software you're working on, but it's rare for programmers to work on software they use. A consulting shop will work for all kinds of clients. In addition to the gobs of information about their own jobs, programmers often need to understand essentials of diverse fields. I, for example, have needed to rapidly learn about: accounting, manufacturing, aircraft maintenance, and radio-nucleotide decay, to name a few.</li>
<li><strong>Research</strong>. Programmers need to be able to figure out how to query the internet for information, then they have to evaluate the dozen different answers and determine which, if any, fit the issue at hand. I spend as much time researching as I programming.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>The template: <em><strong>As a [who/role], I want [what] so that [why]</strong></em></p>
<p>The &quot;why&quot; is optional, but often useful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a Manager, I want to create employee schedules</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As an Employee, I want to see everyone's schedules so I can arrange shift swaps</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As an Analyst, I need to be able to view people's timesheet data in various ways so that I can better understand where work bottlenecks come from</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why-they-work">Why They Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>They're written by stakeholders, typically users.</li>
<li>They quickly capture what users want, in their own words.</li>
<li>They aren't a feature specification. They are <strong>the beginning of a discussion</strong>.</li>
<li>If it's important enough for you (the user) to want, it's important enough for you to add a story</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-if-its-a-big-idea">What If It's a Big Idea?</h2>
<p>User stories often start as big ideas (<em>epics</em>). After discussion, they'll get split into smaller stories that can be better estimated and worked on.</p>
<h2 id="three-steps-in-a-user-story">Three Steps in a User Story</h2>
<ol>
<li>Write the initial story (the <strong>value</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>Discuss</strong> the story and capture the discussion</li>
<li>Determine <strong>acceptance criteria</strong> as needed</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>A user story is done when its acceptance criteria is met.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p><strong>Value (or Title)</strong> As a Manager, I want to create employee schedules</p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What's involved in this?</li>
<li>How would it be done on paper?</li>
<li>How is it being done today?</li>
</ul>
<p>A schedule includes employee name, id, date, from time, and to time.</p>
<p>[mm] I've found that the handwritten schedules end up being changed a lot due to employees swapping shifts, or being sick. All those changes make the schedule hard to read. So, it'd be great to easily reprint the schedule.</p>
<p>[hg] It sounds like how to print or display schedules should be a new story. What if we used kiosks instead of paper? Or maybe an app employees could view on their phones.</p>
<p>[ss] There needs to be control over who can change my schedules.</p>
<p><strong>Acceptance Criteria</strong><br />
Initially, the scheduler system should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show an entire week</li>
<li>Add employee to a day and shift</li>
<li>Show employee total hours</li>
<li>Allow easy changing of who's working a shift</li>
<li>Allow easy swapping of employee shifts</li>
<li>Print a schedule</li>
</ul>
